# Web Accessibility Best Practices

> Web accessibility is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people of all kinds.

Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible.

## Accessibility Practices

-   Keyboard Navigation
-   Screen Readers (Assistive technologies)
-   ARIA_Attributes
-   Semantic HTML

## Keyboard Navigation

Some users like who can't hold mouse or who doesn't have access to mouse might rely on a keyboard instead of a mouse for navigation.

head over to youtube.com and click on the shift + ? button a modal pops up with a list of the keyboard shortcut to access the website.

-   On every website, you can navigate using the tab keyboard.
-   Remember div and spans are not tabbed accessible unless they are added with the attribute tabindex=”0".

```html
<div role="link" tabindex="0">Card Component</div>
```

## Screen Readers

Screen readers are a form of assistive technology that helps users who are blind, visually impaired, or have learning disabilities navigate the web.

-   They translate text into auditory or tactile output by reading it out loud.

### Alt text (Accessible Images)

Make sure you always add an alt attribute to the images, A screen reader will announce that it’s looking at an image and read the alt text.

-   Besides, it will also benefit from seo and cases where your image is not loaded, and hovering on that can describe the defined text of the image.

## ARIA Properties

Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) provide a set of attributes that includes roles, labels, and states that help us communicate semantic information to assistive technology.

-   aria-label
-   aria-labelledby
-   aria-expanded
-   aria-hidden
-   role.

### 1. aria-label:

The aria-label attribute provides the text label for an object, such as a button. When a screen reader encounters the object, the aria-label text is read so that the user will know what it is.

### 2. aria-labelledby:

The purpose of aria-labelledby is the same as that of aria-label.

-   It provides the user with a recognizable, accessible name for an interactive element.
-   If an element has both attributes set, aria-labelledby will be used.
-   aria-labelledby takes precedence over all other methods of providing an accessible name, including aria-label, < label >, and the element's inner text.

The aria-labelledby property has the highest precedence when browsers calculate accessible names.

### 3. aria-expanded:

The aria-expanded indicates to assistive technology whether the controlled element is expanded or collapsed.

The aria-expanded attribute is set on an element to indicate if a control is expanded or collapsed, and whether or not the controlled elements are displayed or hidden.

```html
<button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="widget1">Show widget</button>
```

```html
<button aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="widget1">Hide widget</button>
```

### 4. aria-hidden:

The aria-hidden state indicates whether the element is exposed to an accessibility API.

-   Adding aria-hidden="true" to an element removes that element and all of its children from the accessibility tree.
-   This can improve the experience for assistive technology users.

```html
<button>
    <span class="fa fa-tweet" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="label"> Tweet </span>
</button>
```

### 5. role:

Developers can format one element to look like the other. For instance, we can even format a div to look like a button. So in this case, to help screen readers or any assistive technologies, it's a good practice to provide a role for that perticular element.

```html
<span role="logo">LOGO</span>

<a role="button">Start Here</a>
```

## Semantic HTML:

## Points to remember

-   Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible regardless of different-abilities.
-   Practices - Keyboard Navigation, Screen readers, ARIA attributes, Semantic HTML.
-   tabindex=0 for tabbing divs and spans.
-   Screen readers - text into auditory.
-   Alt text is useful in both images fail to load and for screen readers.
-   aria-label, aria-expanded, aria-removed, role.
-   aria-label provides text label for an element which can be read by screen reader.
