# CSS Units

> CSS units allow you to measure and specify different property values. You use them to modify CSS properties such as margins, padding, height, width etc.

### Absolute length units

-   px
-   cm
-   mm

### Font-Relative length units

-   rem
-   em

### Viewport-Relative length units

-   vw
-   vh
-   vmin
-   vmax
-   % (special case)

## Why to choose Relative units over Absolute units?

Relative units are not fixed. Their values are "relative" to another value. This means that when that other value changes, the relative unit value will also change.

-   An absolute unit will always be the same, regardless of the viewport or font size.

## Which Unit should you choose?

![which-unit](/which-unit.png)

### 1. Root font-size:

Either percentage or nothing (browser default). Percentage-based values can scale more smoothly compared to fixed numbers.

```css
:root {
    font-size: 75%;
}
```

### 2. Padding, Margin and Border:

For padding & margin, better to use rem unit. For border use pixels.

### 3. Width and Height:

For width & height, its better to avoid fixed units, most of the time we never use any width and height for the element as the content decides its width and height.

### 4. Max-Min width & height:

Min-height & width specifies the minimum height & width that an element should have, preventing it from becoming smaller than the specified value.

For max-min width & height, its ok to use pixels.

### 5. Top, bottom, left & right.

As these properties mainly depends on its ancestor, its better to use %.

## Difference between rem & em units

**Rem** (short for “root-em”) unit dictate an element's font size relative to the size of the root element.

-   By default, most browsers use a font size value of 16px.

**Em** unit dicatate an element's font-size relative to its nearest parent.

## Why not to use em units.

The main problem experienced when working with em units is due to the effect on the inheritance of em values.

-   Since every element inherits the font-size of its nearest parent, em values compound linearly as the level of nesting increases.

## Why you should adjust the root font size.

'Rem' units compared to 'px' are capable of creating more responsive websites.

So if we try to convert px values into rem, we'll need to do some math as the default browser font-size is 16px.

-   In lieu of dealing with such cumbersome calculations, we can set the root (HTML) font-size to 62.5%.
-   When the root font/HTML size is 100%, the font-size is 16px by default. But, if you set it to 62.5%, the new root value will be 10px.

```css
:root {
    font-size: 62.5%; /* 16px x 62.5% = 10px */
}
```

-   Now, 10px (1rem) is way too tiny and is a recipe for disaster in terms of good user experience.
-   So we should set it to 1.6rem (16x) again in the body.
-   Everything looks the same on the surface. But still, this time, the new rem set-up will be more responsive than that of the 'px' version.

```css
body {
    font-size: 1.6rem;
}
```

Now we're able to translate all the values into rem units easily.

## Points to remember

-   Rem (root-em) unit dictates an element's font-size relative to size of the root element.
-   Em is relative to its nearest parents front-size.
-   Em inherits its parents font-size and childs sizes can compound linearly.
