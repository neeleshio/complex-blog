# CSS Box Model and Display Properties

> Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create more complex layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items.

The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding, and the content itself.

## Key components of box model

-   **Content**: The content of the box, where text and images appear.
-   **Padding**: Padding is used to create space around the element, inside any defined border.
-   **Border**: The border is used to cover the content & any padding, & also allows setting the style, color, and width of the border.
-   **Margin**: Margin is used to create space around the element ie., around the border area or between 2 elements.

## Box-sizing

The box-sizing property allows us to include or exclude the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

### 1. border-box:

The border-box property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

```css
box-sizing: border-box;
```

### 2. content-box:

content-box is is the default value of box-sizing.

The content-box property allows us to exclude the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

```css
box-sizing: content-box;
```

## Margin Collapsing

Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins.

-   This is not a bug, this is pursosely designed like that to avoid too much spacing.

**Note**: This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins!

_Solution: Margin collapsing only occur in flow layout. So, this can be avoided by using flex, grid or position layout._

## Display Properties

The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline box and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex.

-   Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
-   The default display value for most elements is block or inline.

## Block-level Elements

A block-level element ALWAYS starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

-   They always take full width and stack on each other even if we give them 50% width or 25% width.
-   The browsers automatically add some top and bottom margin to the element.
-   Two commonly used block elements are: < p > and < div >.
-   You can add margins and padding on all four sides of any block element.

## Inline Elements

An inline element DOES NOT start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

-   Two commonly used block elements are:  < a > and < span >.
-   Not able to add top & bottom margin but left & right can be added.
-   Padding can be added but that won't to be relative to the layout meaning the padding gonna spread on top of other elements.
-   Not able to add width & height.

## Inline-block Elements

The major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.

-   Everthing is similar to block level element except it won't take up full width avaialble but just the content width and won't break to next line.
-   They can have padding and margins added on all four sides.
-   Not gonna spread on other elements, it will take its own space in the layout.
