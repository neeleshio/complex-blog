# CSS Position Property

> The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document.

![css-position](/css-position.png)

The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element:

-   static
-   relative
-   absolute
-   fixed
-   sticky

## Static

Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow.

## Fixed

-   Elements with fixed position acts a Inline-Block elements.
-   Viewport as its positioning context or relative to the viewport by default.
-   Give 100% as width to occupy the whole screen. If it overflows then give it a box-sizing: border-box.
-   No matter if u have block level element or an inline level element, you can apply this Fixed positioning property.
-   Use fixed positioning for background images of a page.

## Absolute

As Fixed element are always relative to the viewport, Absolute elements are relative to the nearest ancestors having position property or the parent which having position: relative property applied to it.

## Relative

Relative elements are relative to its origin position.

-   remain in the normal flow of the document. But, unlike static elements, the left, right, top, bottom and z-index properties affect the position of the element.
-   If u dont want the element to go out of its parent element when u applied position: relative, then use overflow: hidden property.

## Sticky

Its a combination of fixed and relative properties. It acts like a relatively positioned element until a certain scroll point and then it acts like a fixed element.

-   Top or Bottom property has to be given, otherwise wont work.
-   It stays at its position until it hits the top or bottom of the viewport.
-   Then acts as a fixed element until its parent gone out of the view.
-   Once its parent out of the view, sticky element will also be out of the view.

## Z-index

By default, z-index: auto; will be applied. and auto is equals to 0.

-   Z-index doesn’t work for non-positioned elements.

**Note**: One exception from this behaviour is flexbox: Applying the z-index  to flex-items (so the elements inside of the flex-container) will change the order of these items even if no position  property was applied.

## Points to remember

-   Default is static.
-   Fixed position always relative to viewport and acts like inline-block element.
-   Absolute position always relative to nearest ancestor having position property or any parent having relative property
-   Relative position always relative to its origin position.
-   Sticky is a combination of fixed and relative position. Stays at its origin position untill it hits top or bottom of viewport.
-   z-index: auto = 0, by default. doesn't work for non-positioned elements.
