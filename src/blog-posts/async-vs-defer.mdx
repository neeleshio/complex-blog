# Async vs Defer attributes

> JavaScript is considered a “parser blocking resource” causing blocking of HTML parsing. Thankfully, the latest technologies such as HTML5 gives you 3 ways to tell browser when to run JavaScript code.

## Async

The script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed as soon as it is available (before parsing completes).

-   Downloads in the background at a low priority (same as defer)
-   Can interrupt page rendering to execute
-   Executes as soon as possible and in no particular order

```html
<script async src="myscript.js"></script>
```

## Defer

The script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing.

-   Downloads in the background at a low priority (same as async)
-   Won't interrupt page rendering to execute
-   Executes in sequence just before the DOMContentLoaded event

```html
<script defer src="myscript.js"></script>
```

If neither **async** or **defer** is present: The HTML is parsed until the script tag is reached. The script is downloaded and executed immediately, blocking parsing until the script execution gets completed.

## When to use Async?

Async is best for very high priority JavaScript resources that should run as early as possible in the loading process.

**Note**: we should only use async when we have scripts that can run independently and don't rely on the DOM structure.

If its an Analytics script, prefer async because you get better statistics over the website & it also not depends on the DOM.

## When to use Defer?

Use defer when we need to maintain script execution order or it depends on the DOM structure.

We usually put our script at the bottom of the page or at the end of the body, instead of that we can consider put it in the head with the defer attribute. So that it gets downloaded in parallel and it gets executed once the DOM parsed completely.

## Can async & defer Be Used On The Same File Reference?

While using both async and defer attributes on the same script reference is valid HTML, it's not recommended as async and defer are best used purposefully, depending on the way any given JavaScript resource should fit into the loading process.

Using both on the same script reference may also cause inconsistent or undesirable cross-browser behavior.

## Should I put script in head or body?

-   Place library script such as the jQuery library in the head section.
-   Place normal script in the head unless it becomes a performance/page load issue.
-   Place script that impacts the render of the page at the end of the body
-   Most of the time it's safe to put it at the bottom of the page unless the documentation specifies otherwise.

**Note:** Always put link tags in the head section.

## CSS should be included in head or body?

CSS should be loaded first so we have to put it in the head itself and JS in the body, for the simple reason that I would rather my visitors see a styled non interactive page first, then get the interactive part after the CSS has loaded.

## Conclusion

Any given resource on a page is first downloaded and then applied to or run on the page. While the loading behavior of async and defer are the same - loading in the background without render blocking - the difference lies in their behavior when executing.

JavaScript files with the async attribute will run in no particular order as soon as they're loaded, whereas defer'd resources run in sequence (in the order they appear in the HTML) toward the end of the initial loading process, right before the DOMContentLoaded event.

The async and defer attributes are great tools to eliminate render blocking JavaScript.

## Points to remember

-   Arrow function is a compact alternative to traditional functions.
-   Are always anonymous functions. Need to assign to a variable to all them.
-   Hoising is similar to variable hoisting.
-   Cannot use a arrow function as constructor function.
