# Flexbox Complete Guide

> CSS Flexbox gives you the tools to create basic and advanced website layouts in flexible and responsive ways.

-   Flexbox makes browsers display selected HTML elements as flexible box models.
-   Flexbox allows easy resizing and repositioning of a flexible container and its items one-dimensionally.
-   "One-dimensionally" means Flexbox allows laying out box models in a row or column at a time.
-   Flexbox cannot lay out box models in a row and column at the same time.
-   Converting an HTML node to a flexible box model makes the element's direct children become flexible items.

## Flex vs Inline-flex

So flex acts as block level element where it takes all the available space in a row or column.

-   Setting an element's display property's value to flex turns the box model into a block-level flexbox.

But, Inline-flex acts as inline element where it takes only the required space by the content inside the element.

-   inline-flex tells browsers to display the selected HTML element as an inline-level flexible box model.
-   If Inline-flex applied then both flex container & flex-items behaves like an inline element means takes only the content’s width & height that is required.

## Flex Containers Properties

-   flex-direction
-   flex-wrap
-   flex-flow
-   justify-content
-   align-items
-   align-content

<br />

### 1. flex-direction:

flex-direction tells browsers the specific direction (row or column) they should lay out a flexible container's direct children.

<br />

### 2. flex-wrap:

flex-wrap specifies whether browsers should wrap overflown flexible items onto multiple lines.

-   nowrap is flex-wrap's default value.
-   It forces all items within a flexible container into a single line.
-   wrap moves all overflow items within a flexible container to the next line.

<br />

### 3. flex-flow:

flex-flow is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties.

```css
section {
    display: flex;
    flex-flow: column wrap;
}
```

### 4. justify-content: (main-axis)

This justify-content property handles the alignment of flex items on the main axis of the flex container.

justify-content property accepts the following values:

-   flex-start
-   center
-   flex-end
-   space-between
-   space-around
-   space-evenly

<br />

### 5. align-items: (cross axis)

The align-items property handles the alignment of flex items on the cross-axis of the flex container.

**stretch** is align-items' default value. It stretches a flexible container's items to fill the flexbox's cross-axis.

![align-items-stretch](/align-items-stretch.png)

The snippet above used the stretch value to stretch the flexible items to fill the section's cross-axis.

<br />

### align-items can take any of the following values:

-   stretch (default value)
-   flex-start
-   flex-end
-   center
-   baseline

When you use the <span className="hgl">baseline</span> value, flex items are arranged such that their baselines are aligned.

![baseline](/baseline.png)

## justify-content vs align-items.

Default value is **strech**.

-   Justify content always align items along the main axis, so justify-content always refers to main axis.
-   Align items always align items along the cross axis, so align-items always refers to cross axis.

## align-content

The CSS align-content property sets the distribution of space between and around content items along a flexbox's cross-axis or a grid's block axis.

-   The align-content property does not affect a flexbox with only one line—for instance, a flexible container with flex-wrap: nowrap.
-   It works only when you have a flex container with wrap or more than one flex line.

So working with multi row flex items then align-content comes into rescue to set the space between the rows.

Let's see some examples with and without align-content:

```css
/* without align-content */
.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-items: start;
}
```

![without align-content](/align-content1.png)

```css
/* with align-content */
.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-items: start;
    align-content: start;
}
```

![with align-content](/align-content2.png)

## place-content

If you need to use both the justify-content and align-content properties, you use the place-content shorthand property.

-   It can take one or two values. When you give it a single value, the browser will apply the same value for both justify-content and align-content.
-   And when you give 2 values for place-content, the first value will be for align-content and the second for justify-content.

```css
.names-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    place-content: flex-end flex-start;
    /* place-content: */ /* align-content justify-content */
}
```

## Flex Item's Properties

The six (6) types of flex item properties are:

-   align-self
-   order
-   flex-grow
-   flex-shrink
-   flex-basis
-   flex

<br />

### 1. align-self:

You can use the align-self property to give a flex item a different alignment from the other items.

-   It works the same way as the align-items property.
-   The difference is that whereas align-items applies to all flex items, the align-self property is applied to only specific items.
-   It aligns along the cross-axis similar to align-items.

```css
.names-container {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    /* Other styles */
}

#jill {
    align-self: flex-start;
}
```

![align-self](/align-self.png)

### 2. flex-grow:

-   When you set a container's display to flex, often there will be some extra space after the items are arranged.
-   The browser treats the extra as a value of 1.
-   This means when you give a flex-grow value of 0.5 to only one of the flex items, the browser will add half of the remaining space to the item's size.

![flex-grow](/flex-grow.png)

-   And if you add a flex-grow value of 1 to only one of the flex items, the browser will add all the extra space to that item.
-   Even if you give 99 it will be equal to 1.

**What happens when you add flex-grow values to more than one element?**

The browser will share the extra space proportionately for them.

<br />

### 3. flex-shrink:

The flex-shrink property is the opposite of flex-grow.

-   If flexbox's size is insufficient to fit the flexible items. In that case, browsers will automatically shrink the items to fit the container.
-   All flex items will have flex-shrink: 1 as default value. Which shrink all the items equally, but if we want to change then we can use any values other than 0 and 1.

```css
.item-1 {
    flex-shrink: 2;
}
```

![flex-shrink-2](/flex-shrink-2.png)

**Note**: Browsers will not shrink flexible items with a flex-shrink value of 0.

```css
.item-1 {
    flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

![flex-shrink-0](/flex-shrink-0.png)

<br />

### 4. flex-basis:

You can use the flex-basis property to set the default length of a specific flex item. This is either the width or height of the item depending on the flex-direction.

```css
.names-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    /* Other styles */
}

div {
    width: 70px;
}

#jane {
    flex-basis: 140px;
}
```

<br />

### 5. flex (Shorthand Property)

You can use flex as a shorthand for the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties. The default values for flex are 1 0 auto.

```css
.flex-item {
    flex-grow: 2;
    flex-shrink: 0;
    flex-basis: 50px;
}
```

```css
.flex-item {
    flex: 2 0 50px;
    /* flex: flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis */
}
```

<br />

## Flexbox Gaps

You can use the gap property to adjust the space between flex items.

**Note**: You apply the gap property on the flex container and not the flex items.

<br />

### 1. Row gap:

Adding gaps between only the rows:

```css
.names-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    row-gap: 20px;
    /* Other Styles */
}
```

### 2. Column gap:

```css
.names-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    column-gap: 20px;
    /* Other Styles */
}
```

### 3. gap: (shorthand)

```css
.names-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    gap: 50px 10px;
    /* row-gap column-gap */
}
```

## Points to remember

-   flex-flow is shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap. flex-wrap: column wrap.
-   justify-content aligns along main-axis.
-   align-items aligns along cross-axis.
-   baseline arranges the flex-item along its content's base.
-   place-content = justify-content + align-content.
-   flex-grow: 1: adds all the extra space to the items's width.
-   flex-shrink: 0: forces fixed width on the item.
-   flex-basis property sets default length to specific flex item.
-   flex: 1 0 auto, shorthand property.
