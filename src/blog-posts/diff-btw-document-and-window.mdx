# Difference between document and window objects

> It can be easy to have misconceptions on the difference between the document and window objects for javascript.

## Window

window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. This window object has the majority of the properties like:

-   length
-   innerWidth
-   innerHeight
-   document
-   fullScreen etc.

Also window object has some methods like:

-   alert()
-   atob()
-   blur()
-   setInterval()
-   prompt() etc.

## Document

The document object represents a web page that is loaded in the browser, i.e, your html, aspx, php or other documents.

The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like:

-   body
-   title
-   URL
-   baseURI
-   cookie etc.

Also document object has some methods like:

-   addEventListener()
-   querySelector()
-   getElementById()
-   createElement()
-   renameNode() etc.

## IFrame

An iframe actually is considered as a new window with its own document loaded into it.

-   The original, parent window, is responsible for other windows to be loaded, not the document.
-   The property to access a frame is window.frames, which is an array of all the frames.
-   If you only have one iframe you access it by using window.frames[0].
-   Since the iframe is also a window object, accessing window properties of that frame is done by using window.frames[0].innerHeight.

## Points to remember

-   window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser.
-   window props and methods - innerWidth, document, setInterval(), alert() etc.
-   document object gets loaded inside the window object.
-   document props and methods - body, title, cookie, getElementById(), createElement() etc.
-   Iframe - a new 'window' object gets created inside the main window.
-   To access Iframe - window.frames[index]
