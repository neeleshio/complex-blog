# CSS Selectors

> CSS selectors are patterns used in CSS to select and style HTML elements on a page, allowing us to dictate how styles apply to specific HTML elements.

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style. We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

-   Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
-   Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
-   Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
-   Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
-   Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

## Simple Selectors

It is used to select the HTML elements based on their element tag name, id, class, etc.

<br />

### Class selector vs Id selector:

-   For styling purpose use **classes**.

-   **Ids** are mostly for sections, to jump from one section to another and also for dom manipulation.

```html
<section id="section-1">Section 1</section>

<a href="#section-1">Click to jump to section 1</a>
```

## Combinator selectors

The CSS nesting module allows you to write nested rules that use combinators to create complex selectors.

-   CSS combinators are explaining the relationship between two selectors. CSS selectors are the patterns used to select the elements for style purposes.

There are four types of combinators available in CSS:

<br />

### 1. Adjacent Sibling selector (+):

Use a plus sign (adjacent combinator) to select an element that is a direct sibling to a first element:

<br />

### 2. General Sibling selector (~):

Use a tilde sign (general sibling combinator) to select every element that is preceded by the first element, without having to be a direct sibling to the first element.

<br />

### 3. Child selector (>):

Use a > sign (child combinator) to select element(s) that are direct children to another element.

<br />

### 4. Descendant selector (space):

Leave a space (descendant combinator) between selectors to select element(s) that are descendant of another element.

## Attribute Selector

The [attribute] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute.

The following example selects all < a > elements with a target attribute and all the text inputs:

```css
a[target] {
    background-color: yellow;
}

input[type='text'] {
    font-size: 2rem;
}
```

## Pseudo-class selectors

Pseudo-classes allow us to define styles based on an element's state or its relation to other elements, like,

-   Hovering over a button
-   Selecting the first item in a list. etc.

Pesudo-classes start with a colon character (:).

<span className="hgl">:link, :visited, :hover & :active</span> These 4 pseudo-classes are useful to select
elements such as links in various states.

```css
a:link {
    background: aliceblue;
}
a:visited {
    background: blanchedalmond;
}

button:hover {
    background: yellow;
}
button:disabled {
    background: grey;
}

input:focus {
    border: 1px solid blue;
}

div:first-child {
    color: red;
}
div::nth-child(2) {
    color: green;
}
```

## Pseudo-elements selectors

pseudo-elements give you the power to target and style specific parts of an element, such as,

-   Its first line
-   before and after its content. etc.

Pseudo-elements start with two colons (::).

The ::before pseudo-element is used to insert content before the content of an element and the ::after pseudo-element is similar to ::before and is used to insert content after the content of an element.

```css
.alert::before {
    content: '⚠️ ';
    margin-right: 0.25rem;
}

.alert::after {
    content: '● ';
    margin-right: 0.25rem;
}
```

### Some useful pseudo-elements selectors

-   ::first-letter
-   ::first-line
-   ::placeholder
-   ::selection
-   ::marker

## Points to remember

-   CSS Selectors are used to find or select HTML elements you want to style.
-   '+' selector to select an element that is direct sibling to the first element.
-   '~' selector to select every element preceded by the first element.
-   '>' selector to select element(s) that are direct children of the selected element.
-   Pseudo-class defines styles based on their states. Ex: :hover :visited :focus.
-   Pseudo-element used to style specific parts of the element. Ex: ::after ::first-letter.
