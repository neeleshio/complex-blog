# Rendering Webpage in the browser - BTS

> Understand the inner workings of browsers and the things they’ve been doing all along: DOMs, CSSOMs, render trees, layout, and paint.

To render a page, the browser needs to follow many steps when you visit a website:

-   Look up your resources.
-   Create a connection between server and client.
-   Incrementally download the resources.
-   Parse the HTML.
-   Parse CSS.
-   Create DOM.
-   Create CSSOM.
-   Creating a render tree from DOM and CSSOM.
-   Start the layout of the page and then paint.

## Lookup and Downloading the resources

When the TCP connection has been made between the server and the client, the data is sent incrementally in small chunks.

-   HTML is rendered incrementally. It’s better to stream the HTML response to the client instead of waiting for the whole page to be ready. (This is not the case in SPAs.)
-   CSS is render-blocking. Get the CSS to the browser as quickly as possible.

When we start receiving the HTML, we start to parse it. This seems straightforward, but it has a lot of complexities. Suppose it comes across the following line:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```

It will stop the parsing of HTML and make a request call to fetch the file.

-   It’ll download the file and parse the file. The same happens with < script > tags.
-   The browser will not render the page without the CSS. If it does, it’ll show an ugly page.
-   This is the reason you put your CSS links in the head, as the page without CSS would look terrible.

## Parse HTML and CSS

Parsing HTML is basically tokenising every bit and piece of the HTML to make something meaningful.

-   HTML parsers are very forgiving and tend to complete a lot of things on their own, like inserting the missing closing tags and so much more.
-   We end up with a DOM tree after this step. We still have a blank screen that is being shown to the end user.

```html
HTML Praser: BYTES -> CHARACTERS -> TOKENS -> NODES -> DOM
```

-   CSS is not like HTML. It cannot be parsed incrementally because of its cascading properties. It has to be parsed once
-   So keep in mind the size of the CSS you’re sending with the initial load.
-   After parsing the CSS, we have a CSSOM. Now let’s move to the next step of creating a render tree.

## Render Tree

Render tree omits all the nodes that are not required, such as display:none, < script >, and < meta > .

-   One important difference that you might have come across is between display:none and visibility: hidden. The render tree doesn’t include the node with display: none, whereas visibility:hidden is included.

The DOM and CSSOM are merged together to create a render tree. This is the last step before the browser starts layouts of the nodes.

## Layout

We still haven’t painted anything on the screen as of yet. In this step, we will be calculating the sizes and positions of the nodes in the tree.

## Painting

After the layout is completed, we finally start to paint the pixels on to the screen. This is where we start to see things on the browsers.

**Important Note**:

Whenever we encounter a < script >, the parsing is completely stopped. We fetch the file, parse the file, run JavaScript, and then continue to parse the HTML bit by bit. If we use document.write() in the script, the parsing will begin again. This can be better explained with the image below.

That is why people tend to have the script at just above the closing body tag. That way, all your parsing is already completed and document nodes are available through JavaScript.

## Repaint and ReFlow

A dedicated article on [reflow and repaint](/blogs/reflow-and-repaint?title=Reflow%20and%20Repaint&topic=HTML&date=8%20May%202024).

## In Brief

-   Browser receives the data (bytes) from the server.
-   Parses and converts into tokens (< TagName, Attribute, AttributeValue >).
-   Turns tokens into nodes.
-   Turns nodes into the DOM tree.
-   Builds CSSOM tree from the css rules.
-   CSSOM and DOM trees are combined into a RenderTree.
-   Not visible elements like (meta, script, link) and display: none are ommited from the render tree.
-   For each visible node, find the appropriate matching CSSOM rules and apply them.
-   Reflow: compute the layout of each visible element (position and size).
-   Repaint: renders the pixels to screen.

## Points to remember

-   TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) - Transfers data in stream of bytes and grouped together at the reciever end.
-   HTML is rendered increamently. It's better to stream HTML response rather than waiting for the whole page to be ready.
-   JS & CSS are a render blocking resources.
-   CSS cannot be parsed increamently.
-   (HTML & CSS) -> Parsing -> (DOM & CSSOM) -> Merging -> (Render tree) -> (Layout) -> Painting
-   Render tree omits nodes such as display:none, meta, script.
