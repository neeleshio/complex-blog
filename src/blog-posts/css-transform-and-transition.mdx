# CSS Transform and Transition Properties

> This post will introduce you to CSS transitions and CSS transforms: the CSS power couple.

When used together, these properties allow you to create simple animations and add valuable interaction and visual feedback for your users.

### At their most basic level:

-   Transforms move or change the appearance of an element.
-   Transitions make the element smoothly and gradually change from one state to another.

## Transform

Transitions are to make an element change from one state to another.

-   With the CSS transform property you can rotate, move, skew, and scale elements.
-   Transforms are triggered when an element changes states, such as on mouse-hover or mouse-click.

## Transform Properties

### 1. Scale:

The scale value allows you to increase or decrease the size of an element.

For example:

-   The value 2 would transform the size to be 2 times its original size.
-   The value 0.5 would transform the size to be half its original size.

```css
div:hover {
    transform: scale(2);
}

div:hover {
    transform: scaleX(1.5);
}

div:hover {
    transform: scaleY(2.5);
}
```

### 2. Rotate:

With the rotate value, the element rotates clockwise or counterclockwise by a specified number of degrees.

-   A positive value, such as 90deg, rotates the element clockwise.
-   while a negative value, such as -90deg, rotates it counterclockwise.

```css
div:hover {
    transform: rotate(90deg);
}
```

You can rotate more than a full rotation with numbers over than 360, such as 1080deg, for three full rotations.

```css
div:hover {
    transform: rotate(1080deg);
}
```

### 3. Translate:

The translate value moves an element left/right and up/down. The movement is based on the parameters given for the X (horizontal) Y (vertical) axes.

-   A positive X value moves the element to the right, while a negative X moves the element to the left.
-   A positive Y value moves the element downwards and a negative Y value, upwards.

In this example, the element will move 20 pixels to the right and 20 pixels down.

```css
div:hover {
    transform: translate(20px, 20px);
}

/* or */

div:hover {
    transform: translateX(20px);
    transform: translateY(20px);
}
```

### 4. Skew:

With the skew value, the element skews (or tilts) one direction or the other based on the values given for the X and Y axes.

![skew](/skew.png)

-   A positive X value tilts the element left, while a negative X value tilts it right.
-   A positive Y value tilts the element down, and a negative Y value tilts is up.
-   Or use a shorthand to include both X and Y properties:

```css
div {
    transform: skewX(25deg);
    transform: skewY(10deg);

    /* or */

    transform: skew(25deg, 10deg);
}
```

## Transition

Transitions are the grease in the wheel of CSS transforms.

-   Without a transition, an element being transformed would change abruptly from one state to another.
-   By applying a transition you can control the change, making it smooth and gradual.

## Transition properties:

-   transition-property (required)
-   transition-duration (required)
-   transition-timing (optional)
-   transition-delay (optional)

shorthand:

```css
div {
    transition: [property] [duration] [timing-function] [delay];
}
```

### 1. transition-property (required):

Specifies the name or names of the CSS properties to which transitions should be applied.

-   Only properties listed here are animated during transitions.

```css
transition-property: none;
transition-property: all;

transition-property: background;
transition-property: height;

transition-property: transform;

/* Multiple values */
transition-property: all, height, color;
```

### 2. transition-duration (required):

The transition-duration property specifies the time span of the transition. You can specify in seconds or milliseconds.

```css
div {
    transition-duration: 3s;
}

/* shorthand */
div {
    transition: all 3s;
}
```

### 3. transition-timing (optional):

The transition-timing-function property allows you to define the speed of the transition over the duration.

-   The default timing is ease, which starts out slow, quickly speeds up, and then slows down at the end.

The other timing options are:

-   linear
-   ease
-   ease-in
-   ease-out
-   ease-in-out.

```css
div {
  transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}

{/* shorthand */}
.circle0 {
    @extend .circle;
    background: PaleTurquoise;
    transition: all 1.5s linear;
}

.circle1 {
    @extend .circle;
    background: salmon;
    transition: all 1.5s ease;
}

.circle2 {
    @extend .circle;
    background: lightskyblue;
    transition: all 1.5s ease-in;
}
```

For more advanced timing options, you can define a custom timing function with a cubic-bezier.

### transition-delay (optional):

The transition-delay property allows you to specify when the transform will start.

-   By default, the transition starts as soon as it is triggered (e.g., on mouse hover).
-   However, if you want to transition to start after it is triggered you can use the transition delay property.

```css
div {
    transition-delay: 250ms;
}

/* shorthand */
.box1 {
    transition: all 1.3s; /* no delay */
}

.box2 {
    transition: all 1.3s 0.5s; /* 0.5s delay */
}

.box3 {
    transition: all 1.3s 1s; /* 1s delay */
}
```
