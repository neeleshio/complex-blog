## SASS - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets

Sass is a CSS preprocessor that gives your CSS superpowers.

Sass provides a compiler that allows us to write stylesheets in two different syntaxes, indented and SCSS.

<br />

### 1. Indented syntax:

This is the older syntax that is indented, and gets rid of the curly braces and semi-colons. It has a file extension of .sass.

```css
nav
  ul
    margin: 0
    padding: 0
    list-style: none

  li
    display: inline-block

  a
    display: block
    text-decoration: none
```

### 2. SCSS syntax: (Sassy CSS)

This is the newer and more popular syntax. It is essentially a subset of the CSS3 syntax. This means that you can write regular CSS with some additional functionalities.

## How Does Sass Work?

Sass works in such a way that when you write your styles in a .scss file, it gets compiled into a regular CSS file.

That is why it's called a Preprocessor.

## Most used Features of SASS: ðŸ‘‡

## 1. Variables:

You can declare variables in Sass. They allow us to store values for colors, fonts or really any CSS value that you want to reuse0.25rem

-   We use the $ symbol when we wish to make something a variable.

```css
$color-primary: #ffff00; /* Yellow */

body {
    background-color: $color-primary;
}
```

## 2. Nesting:

Even HTML has a nesting structure that makes it quite easy to read but CSS lacks this feature.

-   SASS provide nesting feature, we can nest child selectors inside of the parent selector.
-   This results in much cleaner and less repetitive code.

## 3. Mixins:

Mixins are an extremely powerful feature of Sass.

-   mixins are code blocks that allow you to define styles that can be reused throughout a stylesheet.
-   You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible.

<br />

-   To create a mixin you use the @mixin directive and give it a name. Weâ€™ve named our mixin theme.

```css
@mixin theme($theme: DarkGray) {
    background: $theme;
    box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba($theme, 0.25);
    color: #fff;
}
```

-   Weâ€™re also using the variable $theme inside the parentheses so we can pass in a theme of whatever we want.

-   After you create your mixin, you can then use it as a CSS declaration starting with @include followed by the name of the mixin.

```css
.info {
    @include theme;
}
.alert {
    @include theme($theme: DarkRed);
}
.success {
    @include theme($theme: DarkGreen);
}
```

Mixins are also very useful in managing vendor prefixes.

```css
@mixin transform {
    -webkit-transform: rotate(180deg);
    -ms-transform: rotate(180deg);
    transform: rotate(180deg);
}
```

```css
li {
    text-align: center;
    margin: 1rem;
    @include transform;
}
```

Pass custom property:

```css
@mixin transform($property) {
    -webkit-transform: $property;
    -ms-transform: $property;
    transform: $property;
}
```

```css
@include transform(rotate(20deg));
```

## 4. Functions:

Sass functions can receive arguments and return a single value.

-   They make it easy to abstract out common formulas and behaviors in a readable way.
-   Functions are defined using the @function at-rule.25rem
-   As you can see, functions help you write more readable and DRY Sass, as you can utilize reusable logic in a very efficient manner.

```css
@function fibonacci($n) {
    $sequence: 0 1;
    @for $_ from 1 through $n {
        $new: nth($sequence, length($sequence)) + nth($sequence, length($sequence) - 1);
        $sequence: append($sequence, $new);
    }
    @return nth($sequence, length($sequence));
}

.sidebar {
    float: left;
    margin-left: fibonacci(4) * 1px;
}
```

## 5. Partials & Importing

Partials in SASS help us to break up our files into smaller files without affecting performance.

-   The use of partials allows us to modularize our CSS, to help keep things maintainable.
-   We divide up our Sass into separate files representing different components.
-   A partialsâ€™ name will always start with an underscore \_ .
-   We then import the partial using an @use directive.

```css
/* _header.scss */

header {
    width: 100%;
    background-color: green;
}
```

```css
/* main.scss */
@use 'header';

main {
    height: 100vh;
}
```

## 6. Inheritance or Extend

Another great feature of Sass is inheritance. We implement this using the @extend directive.

-   The @extend directive is useful if you have almost identically styled elements that only differ in some small details.
-   The @extend directive lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.

```css
.button-basic {
    border: none;
    padding: 15px 30px;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 16px;
    cursor: pointer;
}

.button-report {
    @extend .button-basic;
    background-color: red;
}
```

## Points to remember

-   Sass is a CSS preprocessor that gives your CSS superpowers.
-   When you write your styles in a .scss file, it gets compiled into a regular CSS file.
-   Variables: use the $ symbol: $color-primary: #ffff00;
-   Nesting: This results in much cleaner and less repetitive code.
-   Mixins: are reusable code blocks: @mixin theme($theme: DarkGray) \{..} and use @include theme to reuse it.
-   Functions: They make it easy to abstract out common formulas and behaviors: @function fibonacci($n) \{..}
-   Partials: Partials in SASS help us to break up our files into smaller files.
-   use underscore \_ to create partials and use @use to import them.
-   Inheritance or Extend: It lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.
-   use @extend to use inheritance.
