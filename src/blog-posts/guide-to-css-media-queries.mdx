# A Guide to CSS Media Queries

> Media queries can modify the appearance (and even behavior) of a website or app based on a matched set of conditions about the user’s device, browser or system settings.

CSS Media queries are a way to target browser by certain characteristics, features, and user preferences, then apply styles or run other code based on those things.

```css
/* When the browser is at least 600px and above */
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
    .element {
        /* Apply some styles */
    }
}
```

Media queries are commonly associated with CSS, but they can be used in HTML and JavaScript as well.

## HTML Media Queries

There’s the < link > element that goes right in the document < head >. In this example. we’re telling the browser that we want to use different stylesheets at different viewport sizes:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- Served to all users -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="all.css" media="all" />
        <!-- Served to screens that are at least 20em wide -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="small.css" media="(min-width: 20em)" />
        <!-- Served to screens that are at least 64em wide -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="medium.css" media="(min-width: 64em)" />
        <!-- Served to print media, like printers -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="print.css" media="print" />
    </head>
    <!-- ... -->
</html>
```

### Why would you want to do that?

It can be a nice way to fine-tune the performance of your site by splitting styles up in a way that they’re downloaded and served by the devices that need them.

-   So, if a small screen device like a phone visits the site, it will only download the stylesheets in the media queries that match its viewport size.
-   But if a larger desktop screen comes along, it will download the entire bunch because it matches all of those queries (well, minus the print query in this specific example).

**Note**: Just to be clear, this doesn’t always prevent the stylesheets that don’t match those media queries from downloading, it just assigns them a <span className="hgl">low loading priority level</span>.

## CSS Media Queries

CSS is the most common place to spot a media query in the wild.

-   They go right in the stylesheet in an @media rule that wraps elements with conditions for when and where to apply a set of styles when a browser matches those conditions.

```css
/* Viewports between 320px and 480px wide */
@media only screen and (min-device-width: 320px) and (max-device-width: 480px) {
    .card {
        background: #bada55;
    }
}
```

```css
@media print {
    /* styles for print media only */
}

@media (max-width: 65rem) {
    /* styles for any device that has a display width of 65rem or less */
}

@media screen and (min-width: 800px) {
    /* styles for screen viewports that have a width of 800px or more */
}
```

### 1. Media Types:

-   all: Matches all devices
-   print: Matches documents that are viewed in a print preview or any media that breaks the content up into pages intended to print.
-   screen: Matches devices with a screen

### 2. Operators

Media queries support logical operators like many programming languages so that we can match media types based on certain conditions.

The @media rule is itself a logical operator that is basically stating that “if” the following types and features are matches, then do some stuff.

-   **and**: Matches screen between min & max width.

```css
/* Matches screen between 320px AND 768px */
@media screen (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 768px) {
    .element {
        /* Styles! */
    }
}
```

-   **or (or comma-separated)**: Matches screen where either of the conditions met.

```css
/* 
  Matches screens where either the user prefers dark mode or the screen is at least 1200px wide */
@media screen (prefers-color-scheme: dark), (min-width 1200px) {
    .element {
        /* Styles! */
    }
}
```

-   **not**: Perhaps we want to target devices by what they do not support or match.

```css
/*This declaration removes the body’s background color when the device is a printer and can only show one color.*/
@media print and (not(color)) {
    body {
        background-color: none;
    }
}
```

-   **only**: The only logical operator is a little bit special and hides the entire query for older browsers. The older browers which doesn't support only will also won't support media queries.
-   Note: legacy browsers that don’t support Media Queries level 3 are rare now so in most cases the use of only is unnecessary.

```css
@media only all and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px) {
    /* ignored by older browsers */
}
```

## Points to remember

-   Media queries are commonly associated with CSS, but they can be used in HTML and JavaScript as well.
-   min-width: alteast and above.
-   max-width: atmost and less than.
-   html mqs: < link rel="stylesheet" href="small.css" media="(min-width: 20em)" />
-   Media types: all, print and screen.
-   Operators: and, or(comma-seperated).
