# Rendering Techniques - CSR, SSG, SSR and ISG

> We will explore four prominent rendering approaches.

## Client Side Rendering (CSR)

This is what most of the web frameworks like Angular and React support out of the box.

-   This is commonly suitable for single page applications (SPA) and applications with lot of user interactions (e.g Games) and highly dynamic content such as forms, and chat applications.
-   Basically web browser will initially load an empty HTML file. Javascript and styles which are loaded after, are responsible for rendering the full user friendly page in the web browser.
-   Client-Side Rendering generates webpages in the browser, fully relying on your JavaScript Code.
-   It's no secret that large files result in increased download time, but there is a catch here: downloading large files at the initial load of the application means significantly less loading time in accessing other pages on that website.
-   You can find common examples of a real-life application like Spotify, Figma, and Google Drive.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Client-Side Rendering was a game-changer and still is — in many cases. Although, a closer look at performance in CSR showed that the more features a website had, the more JS code it had. Recall that more JS code means more download time.

-   Each page will initiate a request to App Server, where it dynamically renders and serves full HTML for that page
-   SSR doesn't solve all the problems of rendering on the web. But it solved many of the issues faced by CSR like faster load times on initial visit.
-   Server-Side Rendering helps generate a webpage on the server just after receiving a request from the browser.

**Some drawbacks like**:

-   Having to make network requests to the server to load a webpage could impact users with less internet bandwidth.
-   SSR also requires a relatively higher volume of computing power to be active.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

Static Site Generation is a very common approach to rendering on the web. This is because most websites, if not all before JavaScript frameworks, were statically generated.

-   Static sites are still very popular, but there are better ways to generate them. This goes to show how important they are in terms of performance on the web.
-   A static site is rendered on a browser exactly how it was generated.
-   The content of a static site is typically unaffected by the user viewing, unlike a web app rendered in CSR, or SSR, where each user can see content based on authentication or authorization.
-   Static sites are ideal for showing content that never changes or is updated once in a while.
-   SSG Webpages are rendered and generated during build-time — before the user attempts to access your webpage. This is why SSG is commonly referred to as pre-rendering.

**A drawbacks like**:

-   A major drawback of rendering with SSG is that a page must be generated for every accessible URL on your website. This could get even more tedious when you have dynamic pages.

## Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

ISR is the next improvement to SSG, where it periodically builds and revalidates the new pages so that content never gets too much out-dated.

-   It allows us to pre-render static pages during build time while periodically regenerating specific pages with updated data.
-   ISR represents an advancement over SSG, involving regular rebuilding and revalidating of pages to prevent content from becoming excessively outdated.
-   ISR is ideal for websites with content that requires frequent updates, such as blogs or news portals.

## Pros and Cons

### 1. Pros

-   SSR: Improved SEO and faster initial load times.
-   CSR: Interactivity, reduced server load.
-   ISR: Balances static content and real-time updates.
-   SSG: Superb performance, enhanced security.

### 2. Cons

-   SSR: Increased server load and more complex as compared to CSR.
-   CSR: Compromised SEO and slower initial load times.
-   ISR: Requires careful triggering for dynamic data.
-   SSG: Limited interactivity and real-time updates compared to dynamic rendering approaches.
