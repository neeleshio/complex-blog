# Styled Components Guide

> styled-components is the leading framework in CSS-in-JS libraries all over the world.

Styled Components is a widely adopted CSS-in-JS library that enables developers:

-   To write CSS code directly within their JavaScript components.
-   By leveraging the power of template literals, Styled Components allows for the creation of dynamic and scoped styles.

## Scoped Styles for Enhanced Isolation:

One of the core benefits of Styled Components is the encapsulation of styles within the components they are associated with

-   Each Styled Component generates a unique class name, ensuring that styles are isolated and do not collide with other components.
-   This scoped approach eliminates the potential for unintended style clashes and greatly improves the maintainability of your codebase.

## Features: ðŸ‘‡

## 1. Style inheritance

We can inherit the styling of a styled component by simply passing it to the styled function.

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.div`
    padding: 10px;
    color: palevioletred;
`;

const ButtonWithBorder = styled(Button)`
    border: 1px solid palevioletred;
`;
```

## 2. Passing props

Props can be passed to styled components just as they are with regular React components. This is possible because styled components are actually React components.

```jsx
<Button color="black">Click Me</Button>
```

```jsx
const Button = styled.button`
    padding: 2px 5px;
    color: ${(props) => (props.color ? props.color : 'white')};
    border-radius: 3px;
`;
```

## 3. Theming

Styled-components provides theming capabilities and enables you to support multiple looks and feels.

-   To enable theming we need to wrap our root component with ThemeProvider component.

```jsx
const darkTheme = false;

<ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme ? darkThemeColors : lightThemeColors}>
    <BrowserRouter>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    </BrowserRouter>
</ThemeProvider>;
```

## 4. Switching component types

Styled components are dynamic in nature. They can change from creating and rendering one HTML element to another.

```jsx
const Button = styled.button`
    padding: 2px 5px;
    color: ${(props) => props.theme.color};
    border-radius: 3px;
`;
```

The Button component will create and render a button element. We can change that when rendering the Button component by passing the as props to it with whatever HTML tag name we want it to change to.

```jsx
<Button as="a">Click Me</Button>
```

## Advantages

### 1. Component-Based Styling:

Styled-components enable you to write styles directly within your React components using tagged template literals.

-   This promotes a component-based approach to styling, encapsulating styles with the components they affect.

### 2. Dynamic Styling:

styled-components can accept props and create dynamic styles based on those props.

-   Which is particularly useful when dealing with different states or themes.

## Some of the disadvantages: ðŸ‘‡

## Performance Overheads

Styled-components, being a runtime styling solution, dynamically injects styles into the DOM.

-   This can bring about potential performance bottlenecks, especially in expansive applications.

<br />

### 1. Rendering Delays:

Styled-components can lead to slight delays in rendering as styles are computed on-the-fly.

### 2. Increased JavaScript Execution:

As styles are parsed and injected via JavaScript, this increases the total JavaScript execution time, potentially impacting the user experience.

## Bundle Size Concerns

Every library added to a project impacts its bundle size.

<br />

### 1. JavaScript Overhead:

Styled-components introduces additional JavaScript, potentially slowing down the appâ€™s initial load time if optimizations like tree shaking arenâ€™t employed.

### 2. Contrast with Alternatives:

Sass gets compiled into plain CSS, meaning zero JavaScript overhead.

-   Tailwind, being utility-centric, is tree-shakable, allowing for efficient bundling.

## Points to remember

-   Styled comps to write CSS code directly within Javascript file/components.
-   Advantage is encapsulation of styles within the components they are associated with and prevent style clashes.
-   Style inheritance: const ButtonWithBorder = styled(Button)``.
-   Passing props: Props can be passed to styled components just as they are with regular React components.
-   This is possible because styled components are actually React components.
-   Being a runtime styling solution, dynamically injects styles into the DOM, which is an overhead.
