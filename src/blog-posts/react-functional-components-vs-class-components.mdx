# React Functional Components Vs Class Components

> When diving into the world of React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, one of the fundamental concepts you'll encounter is the distinction between functional and class components.

React components come in two flavors: class components and functional components.

## React Class Components

Class components are the more traditional method, which has been part of React since its inception.

-   They are ES6 classes that extend React (React.Component) to include features like the render method, which returns a React element to be displayed on the screen.
-   Class components are also known for their ability to hold and manage state and lifecycle methods, making them suitable for more complex components.
-   A class component requires a render function responsible for returning the UI that should be rendered.
-   This type of component not only allows you to render a React element but also provides the ability to encapsulate state and behavior

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
    }
}
```

## Key Characteristics of Class Components ðŸ‘‡

## 1. State Management:

Class components can hold and manage local state using this.state property and update it with this.setState().

```javascript
class StatefulComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { count: 0 };
    }

    incrementCount = () => {
        this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    };

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
                <button onClick={this.incrementCount}>Increment</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

## 2. Lifecycle Methods:

Class components have access to React lifecycle methods which allow you to run code at specific points in the component's lifecycle, such as when it mounts, updates, or unmounts.

```javascript
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log('Component did mount');
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log('Component did update');
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    console.log('Component will unmount');
  }
```

## React Functional Components

Functional components were once known as stateless components due to their lack of state management capabilities.

-   Functional components in React are simply JavaScript functions that return React elements
-   Hooks has shifted the React landscape significantly, as functional components can now perform almost all the tasks that class components can, but with a simpler and more concise syntax.
-   Unlike class components, functional components do not have instances, making them lighter and often leading to less boilerplate code.
-   Functional components can be slightly more efficient than class components. They avoid the overhead of class objects and are more accessible for React to optimize.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function StateExample() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

## Why use Functional components over Class components

In javascript, classes are not real classes, they are just syntactic sugar, behind they are actually functions itself.

Functions are straight forward, so 3 things actually motivated react team to introduce hooks to provide lifecycle features to functional components.

1. Complex components become hard to understand.
2. Classes confuse both humans and machines.
3. It's hard to resuse stateful logic b/w components.

In Javascript, the 'this' keyword acts differently than other language, so there will be some learning curve for someone who is coming from other languages.
